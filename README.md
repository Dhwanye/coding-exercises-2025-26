# Coding Exercises 2025-26 (Java)

## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains two coding exercises implemented in **Java**, demonstrating strong knowledge of  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and Software Design Patterns**.

The goal is to showcase high-quality, maintainable, and extensible code through both **conceptual design pattern examples** and a **mini-project**.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Design Patterns in Java
A collection of **six classic design pattern implementations** with simple real-world use cases.  
Patterns are grouped into **Behavioral, Creational, and Structural** categories.

- **Behavioral Patterns**
  - Strategy Pattern â†’ Shopping Cart with multiple payment methods  
  - Observer Pattern â†’ Weather Station notifying observers  

- **Creational Patterns**
  - Singleton Pattern â†’ Logger with a single instance  
  - Factory Pattern â†’ Shape Factory (Circle, Rectangle)  

- **Structural Patterns**
  - Adapter Pattern â†’ Media Player supporting multiple formats  
  - Decorator Pattern â†’ Coffee shop with add-ons like sugar and milk

### 2. Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer
A **console-based CRUD application** that manages astronaut daily schedules.  
Demonstrates real-world application of design patterns with validation and error handling.

- Add, remove, and view tasks (sorted by time)  
- Prevent overlapping schedules  
- Error messages for invalid inputs  
- Optional: Edit tasks, mark as complete, filter by priority  

**Design Patterns Used**  
- Singleton â†’ `ScheduleManager` ensures only one instance  
- Factory â†’ `TaskFactory` manages task creation  
- Observer â†’ Notifies users of task conflicts

## ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of **six design patterns**  
- Demonstrating **SOLID principles** and **clean code practices**  
- Handling **exceptions, validations, and logging** in real-world style projects  
- Gaining experience in writing extensible and modular Java applications
